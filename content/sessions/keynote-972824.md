Open source is often seen as a world of code, collaboration, and community. But for founders, it can also be a tough place filled with business choices, doubts from investors, and the challenge of balancing ideals with survival.

In this talk, I’ll share a real and honest story of how an Apache project—started with passion and supported by a global community—grew into a funded company that now serves enterprise customers.  We’ll explore how community love was transformed into a sustainable business model, what VCs often get wrong about OSS startups, and how founders can navigate the chaos between contributors and customers.

If you're a technical founder walking the tightrope between open values and commercial reality, this is the survival guide I wish I had.
