BifroMQ is a Java-based, high-performance MQTT broker currently incubating at the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed from the ground up to support native multi-tenancy, linear scalability, and massive concurrent connections—all while ensuring consistently low-latency messaging.
In this session, we will explore the architectural principles that shape BifroMQ’s design, driven by the unique challenges of building a multi-tenant distributed MQTT broker.
