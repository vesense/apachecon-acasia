So far CDC is not supported within Apache Kudu, so there is no way to read data from it in a streaming style like other CDC enabled data sources when integrating with Apache Flink. To overcome this, a Apache Flink source connector has been built to unlock the ability for Apache Kudu to stream the data in a continuous and incremental way. In this speech, we will discuss and share the detailed design and implementation for the solution.
