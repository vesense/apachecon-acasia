How should we design tools and services for AI agents? Should we keep baking custom APIs, or is there a better way? This session introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a new open protocol that enables AI agents to discover and call external tools in a secure, structured way.

We’ll cover the basics of MCP (host/client/server roles, lifecycle, standard I/O vs. HTTP), compare it to existing agent tool APIs (LangChain, OpenAI tool format), and argue for why an open protocol is necessary to avoid fragmentation in the AI ecosystem. Using real-world examples, we’ll discuss how to convert an existing CLI tool or API into an MCP service and how to expose it safely through Wasm runtimes or serverless functions.
