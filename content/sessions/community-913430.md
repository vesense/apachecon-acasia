The Ant Group Open Source Incubation, deeply rooted in the principles of the Apache Way, is a dedicated platform fostering innovation and collaboration within the open-source ecosystem. It embraces the core tenets of community-driven development, meritocracy, transparency, and open communication, ensuring that projects nurtured under its umbrella adhere to the highest standards of quality, inclusivity, and sustainability.

The Ant Open Source Incubator refers to the support and management of the full life cycle of open-source projects. It ensures that projects comply with the standards of a healthy open-source community. Depending on the needs of projects at different stages, it integrates the resources of Ant Open Source to maximize their value.

Peggy Dong: Ant Group,Open Source Governance Expert

I believe  Open source represents a force for good. Being attracted by the concepts of open source, collaboration and sharing, I joined Ant Open Source OSPO for three years. Before this, I was mainly engaged in strategic planning, hoping to bring a different perspective to open source governance.
