The open-source world is an ecosystem in which projects and communities are interconnected. Understanding a project's health through measurements and seeking suitable means to achieve a prosperous and sustainable open-source software community is a topic of great concern for both maintainers and community developers. The health of an open-source project is not limited to traditional metrics of software engineering quality and iteration management; it also encompasses factors such as community status and values within open collaboration.

The developer ecosystem and community atmosphere play a significant role in these evaluations, which presents substantial challenges in effectively measuring community health—whether it be through data collection, identity authentication, or the construction of evaluation metrics.

In this talk, two members of the CHAOSS community will discuss the challenges of measuring open-source community health based on CHAOSS metrics, as well as a series of practical implementations in enterprises, including:
 1.Macro observability of overall ecological trends;
 2. Meso-level insights into the observability of open-source community ecosystems;
 3. Micro-level evaluations and incentives for developer contributions.

Additionally, this session will feature a Birds of a Feather (BoF) segment, inviting project owners (practitioners) and researchers in attendance to discuss the challenges faced during project maintenance and how measurements and operations can help communities grow better.
