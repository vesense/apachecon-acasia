[RobustMQ](https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq)  is an open-source message queue 100% developed based on the Rust language. It hopes to explore the possibility of combining Rust with message queues, with the goal of delivering a message queue that supports multiple mainstream message protocols, has a fully Serverless architecture, is low-cost, and elastic. Its vision is to tailor a unified messaging infrastructure for AI systems and provide a unified and efficient communication base for AI applications.


Content of this sharing:
1. Why do we write [RobustMQ](https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq)?
2. The differences between [RobustMQ](https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq)  and existing components in other message queue systems.
3. How did we implement a distributed storage system from scratch using Rust?
4. We have released the first version of [RobustMQ](https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq)  MQTT. How was it implemented and what was its effect?
5. Future roadmap of [RobustMQ](https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq) .

At the same time, we hope to find students who are interested in implementing infrastructure components, message queues, and distributed storage systems with Rust, and explore the infinite possibilities of Rust in infrastructure together.
